# Gender-Detection (from scratch) using Deep Learning
The keras model is created by training the network form scratch on around 2000 face images (~1000 for each class). Face region is cropped by applying face detection using 'cvlib' on the images gathered from Google Images. It achieved around 98% training accuracy and ~94% validation accuracy (20% of the dataset is used for validation).
